Predicting SKF India's Sales


This project predicts future sales trends for SKF India Ltd, a leading rolling bearing manufacturer. We use historical sales data from December 2015 to September 2023 to gaze into the future.

The project applies different prediction techniques - from visualizing trends to modeling sales. The forecasts consider both long-term shifts and seasonal fluctuations.

Some key methods:

Looking at the data
32 quarters of sales data analyzed
Sales trends spotted through moving averages
Seasonal patterns identified by analyzing yearly cycles
Modeling time patterns
Regressions done to find relationships
Linear, quadratic and cubic models tested
Cubic chosen as the best fitting curve
Final predictions
Equation includes cubic terms and seasons
Coefficients converted into sales forecasts
Model fit (R-squared) assessed for accuracy
The project gives SKF India data-driven forecasts to guide their future path. Instead of guesswork, we rely on solid quant modeling to predict ahead!
